# Todo List Application

## Project Information

A mini project to practice some aspects of **MERN** (Mongo DB, Express, React and Node.js). To develop a full-stack web application form scratch.  
 
 - Creating a frontend with REACT.
 - Creating a Backend (Mongo, Express and Node) 
 - Understanding How states work with react. 

 ## Concepts Covered: 
 Here's some description of **MERN** throughout the application and how it is deployed to create the application. 

 - **Mongo DB**: Non-relational database, mostly uses documents for database entry. Each document stored represents a whole object within the database instead of having different objects spread across the database. 
 - **Express**: Express is a backend web application framework for node.js that helps in the development of web app and API's. Express is an  extension of node.js.  
 - **Node.JS**: Node.js is a backend crossplatform for javascript for web browser. 
 - **React**: React is a frontend javascript library, that follows a component based approach when desingign user based components.

 ## Installation 

 This section gives a list of instructions that are needed to download the software to get a devlopment environment running, which are listed in the prerequisites section of the README. 

 1. Once clonning the repository, open the folder or add the folder into the workspace on **Visual Studio Code**. 
 2. Double check that the **node_modules** folder for both backend and frontend have been installed. 
 3. Open an intergrated terminal and run the command `npm install` to install all the packages to the local machine.
